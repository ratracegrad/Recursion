# Recursion
Recursion is a technique for solving problems wherein a function makes calls to itself. By doing so, it can complete a small amount of the processing, and delegate the rest of the problem to the recursive calls.

You can use recursion on problems where smaller parts of the problem look the same as the larger problem as a whole.

# stringifyJSON, parseJSON and getElementsByClassName
These 3 functions are widely used by developers to send or receive information or to find information in the DOM. They are all recursive functions.

Instead of relying on these built-in functions, I have written my own version of all 3 functions using recurssion.

###Note: The tests in this repo are written using Jasmine, a JavaScript testing framework.
